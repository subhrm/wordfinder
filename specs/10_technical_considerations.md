### 3. Technical Considerations

#### 3.1. React Components

Consider the following React components:

* **`App` (Main Component):** Manages overall state, word list loading, and potentially routing (if future features are added).
* **`WordInputForm`:** Encapsulates all the input fields, search button, and clear button. Manages its own local state for the input values and passes them up to a parent component for filtering.
* **`ResultsDisplay`:** Receives the filtered words as props and renders them.
* **`LoadingIndicator`:** Simple component for showing loading state.

#### 3.2. State Management

* **Word List:** The loaded word list should be stored in the application's state (e.g., `useState` in `App` or a more advanced state management solution like Redux/Context API if the project scales).
* **Filter Criteria:** The values from all input fields should be managed in the state of `WordInputForm` and then passed to the filtering logic.
* **Filtered Words:** The result of the filtering operation should be stored in the state of `App` (or a parent component) and passed down to `ResultsDisplay`.

#### 3.3. Performance

* **Filtering Efficiency:** For potentially large word lists, optimize the filtering logic to be efficient. Avoid re-calculating filters unnecessarily. Debouncing input changes could be considered if performance becomes an issue with very frequent typing.
* **Memoization:** Consider using `React.memo` or `useMemo`/`useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components, especially the `ResultsDisplay` if the word list is large.

#### 3.4. Styling

* **Framework Agnostic:** Do not prescribe a specific CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap). Leave it to the developer's discretion or project standards.
* **Responsiveness:** The UI should be reasonably responsive and usable on different screen sizes.
